# ðŸ“„ Project Overview: Automated Third-Party App Patching System

## Purpose
Automate the end-to-end process of downloading, processing, and deploying third-party application updates through Jamf Pro patch management, eliminating manual intervention and reducing security exposure window.

## Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Automated package download from vendor sources
  - Package processing and repackaging for Jamf deployment
  - Jamf patch title and definition management
  - Smart group-based deployment cycles
  - GitHub Actions workflow orchestration
  - Support for major third-party applications (1Password, Chrome, Firefox, Slack, Zoom, etc.)

- **Out of Scope:**
  - macOS system updates
  - Custom/in-house applications
  - Direct end-user communication
  - Package signing/notarization

## Stakeholders
| Role | Responsibility | Contact |
|------|---------------|---------|
| IT Admin | System owner, configuration | Primary user |
| Security Team | Compliance verification | Reviewers |
| End Users | Receive updates | Impacted parties |
| Jamf Admin | Platform management | Support |

## Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1: Core Infrastructure | Week 1 | Project structure, Jamf API integration |
| Phase 2: Download & Processing | Week 2 | Package handlers, verification |
| Phase 3: Patch Management | Week 3 | Jamf integration, policy creation |
| Phase 4: Orchestration | Week 4 | GitHub Actions, automation |
| Phase 5: Testing & Deployment | Week 5-6 | Testing, documentation, rollout |

## Related Systems/Tools

### Core Dependencies
- **Jamf Pro**: Patch management platform
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow orchestration
- **Python 3.11+**: Primary scripting language
- **macOS Runner**: Local GitHub Actions runner

### Integrated Tools
- **AutoPkg patterns**: Download and caching logic
- **Installomator patterns**: Application label system
- **JamfUploader patterns**: API integration approaches

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Zero-touch patching for configured applications
- âœ… < 24-hour deployment window for critical updates
- âœ… 99% success rate for patch deployments
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and audit trail
- âœ… Rollback capability for failed deployments

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API changes | High | Version pinning, error handling |
| Package corruption | Medium | Checksum verification |
| Network failures | Medium | Retry logic, caching |
| Deployment conflicts | Low | Smart group targeting |
